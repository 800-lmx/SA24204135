\usage{
nearest_neighbor_matching(
  data,
  treatment,
  covariates,
  caliper = 0.05,
  replace = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the treatment variable and covariates.}

\item{treatment}{A character string specifying the treatment variable (binary: 0 or 1).}

\item{covariates}{A character vector of covariate names used for propensity score calculation.}

\item{caliper}{A numeric value specifying the maximum allowable distance for matching. Default is 0.05.}

\item{replace}{A logical value indicating whether to allow replacement of matched controls. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data frame with treated and matched control units.
}
\description{
This function performs nearest neighbor matching based on propensity scores, 
matching treated units to control units. Optionally, a caliper can be specified to 
limit the maximum allowable distance for matching.
